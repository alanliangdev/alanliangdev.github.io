# Alan Liang's Personal Site

This is my personal website built with Material for MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

To run the site locally:

1. Install MkDocs and the Material theme:
   ```
   pip install mkdocs-material
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   mkdocs serve
   ```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8000

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Structure

- `docs/`: Contains all the markdown files for the site
  - `index.md`: The homepage
  - `blog/`: Blog posts
- `mkdocs.yml`: Configuration file for MkDocs
