# This is a placeholder for the Kubernetes Platform project image
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file showing:
# - Kubernetes cluster architecture
# - Self-service portal interface
# - Platform monitoring dashboards
# - Resource utilization metrics

# For now, creating a text placeholder that can be replaced with actual image
