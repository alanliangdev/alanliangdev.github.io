# This is a placeholder for the Infrastructure as Code Framework project image
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file showing:
# - Terraform module architecture
# - Multi-cloud deployment diagram
# - Infrastructure provisioning workflow
# - Cost optimization results

# For now, creating a text placeholder that can be replaced with actual image
