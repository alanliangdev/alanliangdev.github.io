# GitOps with ArgoCD: Best Practices

Implementing GitOps at scale requires careful planning and the right tooling. Here's how we built a GitOps platform that serves 50+ development teams.

## Why GitOps?

GitOps provides:

- **Declarative deployments**
- **Version control for infrastructure**
- **Automated rollbacks**
- **Audit trails**

## Our ArgoCD Setup

### Application of Applications Pattern

We use the "app of apps" pattern to manage multiple applications:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: team-applications
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/company/gitops-apps
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: teams/
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

### Multi-Environment Strategy

- **Development**: Auto-sync enabled
- **Staging**: Manual sync with approval
- **Production**: Manual sync with multiple approvals

## Security Considerations

1. **RBAC**: Team-specific access controls
2. **Secret management**: External Secrets Operator
3. **Image scanning**: Integrated with Harbor registry
4. **Policy enforcement**: Open Policy Agent

## Results

- **99.5%** deployment success rate
- **5 minute** average deployment time
- **Zero** configuration drift incidents
- **100%** audit compliance

GitOps isn't just about tools - it's about establishing reliable, repeatable processes that scale with your organization.
