# AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

Cloud costs can spiral out of control quickly, especially in large organizations. Here's how we reduced our AWS bill by 40% without compromising performance or reliability.

## The Problem

Our monthly AWS bill had grown to over $500K, with costs increasing 20% quarter-over-quarter. Leadership wanted answers, and more importantly, they wanted results.

## Our Approach

### 1. Visibility First

You can't optimize what you can't measure. We implemented comprehensive cost tracking:

```python
# Cost allocation tagging strategy
REQUIRED_TAGS = {
    'Environment': ['prod', 'staging', 'dev'],
    'Team': 'team-name',
    'Project': 'project-code',
    'CostCenter': 'cost-center-id'
}

# Automated tagging enforcement
def enforce_tagging(resource):
    missing_tags = []
    for tag, values in REQUIRED_TAGS.items():
        if tag not in resource.tags:
            missing_tags.append(tag)
    
    if missing_tags:
        send_alert(f"Resource {resource.id} missing tags: {missing_tags}")
        # Auto-shutdown non-compliant resources after 7 days
```

### 2. Right-Sizing Instances

We found that 60% of our EC2 instances were over-provisioned:

- **Analysis period**: 30 days of CloudWatch metrics
- **Key metrics**: CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O
- **Action**: Automated recommendations with approval workflow

**Results**: 25% reduction in EC2 costs

### 3. Reserved Instance Strategy

Implemented a data-driven RI purchasing strategy:

```bash
# Calculate optimal RI mix
aws ce get-reservation-coverage \
  --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-01-31 \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE \
  --metrics UnblendedCost
```

**Results**: 30% savings on predictable workloads

### 4. Storage Optimization

S3 storage was our second-largest cost driver:

- **Lifecycle policies**: Automatic transition to IA/Glacier
- **Intelligent Tiering**: For unpredictable access patterns
- **Duplicate detection**: Removed 2TB of duplicate data

```json
{
  "Rules": [{
    "ID": "OptimizeStorage",
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "Transitions": [
      {
        "Days": 30,
        "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
      },
      {
        "Days": 90,
        "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 5. Auto-Scaling Optimization

Fine-tuned our auto-scaling policies:

- **Predictive scaling**: Based on historical patterns
- **Custom metrics**: Application-specific scaling triggers
- **Scheduled scaling**: For known traffic patterns

## Monitoring and Governance

### Cost Anomaly Detection

Set up automated alerts for unusual spending:

```yaml
# CloudWatch alarm for cost anomalies
CostAnomalyAlarm:
  Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
  Properties:
    AlarmName: UnusualSpending
    MetricName: EstimatedCharges
    Threshold: 1000
    ComparisonOperator: GreaterThanThreshold
    EvaluationPeriods: 1
```

### Regular Cost Reviews

Monthly cost review meetings with:
- Team leads
- Finance stakeholders  
- Engineering managers

## Results After 6 Months

| Category | Before | After | Savings |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| EC2 | $200K | $150K | 25% |
| S3 | $80K | $50K | 37% |
| RDS | $120K | $90K | 25% |
| **Total** | **$500K** | **$300K** | **40%** |

## Key Lessons

1. **Tagging is critical** - Without proper tagging, you're flying blind
2. **Automate everything** - Manual cost optimization doesn't scale
3. **Culture matters** - Make cost awareness part of your engineering culture
4. **Regular reviews** - Set up recurring cost review processes
5. **Start small** - Pick low-hanging fruit first to build momentum

## Tools We Used

- **AWS Cost Explorer**: For analysis and reporting
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: For optimization recommendations  
- **CloudHealth**: For multi-account cost management
- **Custom dashboards**: Built with CloudWatch and Grafana

Cost optimization isn't a one-time project - it's an ongoing discipline that requires the right tools, processes, and culture.
