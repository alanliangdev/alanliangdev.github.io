# AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

Managing cloud costs at enterprise scale requires a systematic approach. Here's how we reduced our AWS bill by 40% while maintaining performance and reliability.

## The Problem

Our AWS costs were growing faster than our business. Despite having monitoring in place, we lacked visibility into cost drivers and optimization opportunities.

## Our Approach

### 1. Right-Sizing Resources

We implemented automated right-sizing recommendations:

- **EC2 instances**: Downsized 30% of instances
- **RDS databases**: Optimized instance types
- **EBS volumes**: Converted to gp3 where appropriate

### 2. Reserved Instance Strategy

- Purchased 1-year RIs for stable workloads
- Used Savings Plans for compute flexibility
- Achieved 60% coverage on compute costs

### 3. Storage Optimization

- Implemented S3 lifecycle policies
- Moved infrequent data to IA storage classes
- Enabled S3 Intelligent Tiering

## Results

- **40% cost reduction** in 6 months
- **Zero performance impact**
- **Improved cost visibility** across teams

The key is treating cost optimization as an ongoing process, not a one-time project.
