# Scaling Kubernetes at Enterprise Level

When you're managing Kubernetes infrastructure for 50+ development teams, you quickly learn that what works for a small startup doesn't scale to enterprise environments. Here are the key lessons I've learned from building and scaling our Kubernetes platform at Commonwealth Bank.

## The Challenge

Our journey started with a simple question: How do we provide a self-service platform that allows development teams to deploy their applications without compromising security, reliability, or cost efficiency?

The answer wasn't just about Kubernetes itself, but about building the right abstractions and tooling around it.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Tenancy Strategy

We implemented a **namespace-per-team** approach with strict RBAC policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: team-payments
  labels:
    team: payments
    cost-center: "12345"
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  namespace: team-payments
  name: team-payments-developers
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: team-payments
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### 2. Resource Governance

Every namespace gets default resource quotas and limit ranges:

- **CPU**: 4 cores per namespace
- **Memory**: 8GB per namespace  
- **Storage**: 50GB per namespace
- **Pod count**: 20 pods maximum

### 3. GitOps Everything

We use ArgoCD for all deployments with a strict GitOps workflow:

1. Developers push to their app repo
2. CI pipeline builds and pushes images
3. CI updates the GitOps repo
4. ArgoCD syncs changes to the cluster

## Monitoring and Observability

The key metrics we track:

- **Resource utilization** per team
- **Deployment frequency** and success rates
- **MTTR** for incidents
- **Cost allocation** by team/project

## Results

After 18 months of operation:

- **99.9%** platform uptime
- **40%** reduction in infrastructure costs
- **80%** faster deployment times
- **Zero** security incidents

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with governance** - Set up RBAC, quotas, and policies from day one
2. **Automate everything** - Manual processes don't scale
3. **Monitor costs** - Kubernetes can get expensive fast without proper controls
4. **Invest in developer experience** - Self-service capabilities are crucial
5. **Plan for failure** - Chaos engineering and disaster recovery are essential

The journey to enterprise-scale Kubernetes isn't just about the technology - it's about building the right processes, tooling, and culture around it.
