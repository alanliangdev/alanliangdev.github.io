# Enterprise Kubernetes Platform

## Project Overview

Built a comprehensive self-service Kubernetes platform that transformed how 200+ development teams deploy and manage applications at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The platform reduced deployment time from weeks to minutes while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance standards.

## Key Achievements

- **Scale**: Supporting 200+ development teams across multiple business units
- **Performance**: Reduced application deployment time from 2-3 weeks to under 10 minutes
- **Cost Optimization**: Achieved 35% reduction in infrastructure costs through automated resource optimization
- **Reliability**: Maintained 99.9% platform uptime with automated failover and disaster recovery

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Multi-region EKS clusters with automated scaling
- **GitOps Deployment**: ArgoCD-based continuous deployment pipeline
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management and security
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and custom alerting
- **Security**: Pod Security Standards, Network Policies, and RBAC

### Infrastructure as Code

```yaml
# Example Terraform configuration for EKS cluster
module "eks_cluster" {
  source = "./modules/eks"
  
  cluster_name    = "platform-${var.environment}"
  cluster_version = "1.28"
  
  node_groups = {
    general = {
      instance_types = ["m5.large", "m5.xlarge"]
      scaling_config = {
        desired_size = 3
        max_size     = 10
        min_size     = 1
      }
    }
  }
  
  addons = [
    "vpc-cni",
    "coredns",
    "kube-proxy",
    "aws-load-balancer-controller"
  ]
}
```

## Self-Service Portal

Developed a web-based portal that allows development teams to:

- **Provision Namespaces**: Automated namespace creation with proper RBAC
- **Deploy Applications**: GitOps-based deployment workflows
- **Monitor Resources**: Real-time metrics and logging access
- **Manage Secrets**: Integrated secret management with AWS Secrets Manager
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-team cost allocation and optimization recommendations

## Automation & DevOps

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Code Commit**: Developers push to Git repository
2. **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and container image building
3. **Security Scanning**: Container vulnerability and compliance checks
4. **GitOps Sync**: ArgoCD deploys to appropriate environments
5. **Monitoring**: Automated health checks and alerting

### Cost Optimization

- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatic node scaling based on demand
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler**: Right-sizing pod resource requests
- **Spot Instance Integration**: 60% cost reduction for non-critical workloads
- **Resource Quotas**: Preventing resource waste through governance

## Security & Compliance

### Security Features

- **Pod Security Standards**: Enforced security policies across all workloads
- **Network Segmentation**: Calico network policies for micro-segmentation
- **Image Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and policy enforcement
- **Secrets Management**: Integration with AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault

### Compliance

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all platform activities
- **Policy Enforcement**: Open Policy Agent (OPA) for governance
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup strategies with point-in-time recovery
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region failover capabilities

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics & Alerting

- **Cluster Metrics**: Node health, resource utilization, and performance
- **Application Metrics**: Custom metrics collection and visualization
- **SLA Monitoring**: Automated SLA tracking and reporting
- **Incident Response**: Integration with PagerDuty for automated alerting

### Dashboards

Created comprehensive Grafana dashboards for:
- Platform health and performance
- Per-team resource utilization
- Cost analysis and optimization opportunities
- Security and compliance metrics

## Impact & Results

### Business Impact

- **Developer Productivity**: 10x faster deployment cycles
- **Cost Savings**: $2.4M annual infrastructure cost reduction
- **Reliability**: 99.9% platform availability
- **Security**: Zero security incidents related to platform vulnerabilities

### Technical Metrics

- **Deployment Frequency**: From monthly to multiple times per day
- **Lead Time**: Reduced from 2-3 weeks to under 10 minutes
- **Recovery Time**: Mean time to recovery under 15 minutes
- **Resource Efficiency**: 35% improvement in resource utilization

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **GitOps Approach**: Declarative configuration management simplified operations
- **Self-Service Model**: Empowering teams reduced operational overhead
- **Automation First**: Investing in automation paid dividends at scale
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring enabled proactive issue resolution

### Challenges Overcome

- **Cultural Change**: Extensive training and documentation for adoption
- **Legacy Integration**: Gradual migration strategy for existing applications
- **Security Concerns**: Collaborative approach with security teams for compliance
- **Scale Challenges**: Iterative improvements to handle growing demand

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Extending platform to Azure and GCP
- **AI/ML Workloads**: Specialized support for machine learning pipelines
- **Edge Computing**: Extending platform to edge locations
- **Advanced Networking**: Service mesh expansion and traffic optimization
